# 🎲 Dice Dual

**Dice Dual** is a fully on-chain, 1-vs-1 multiplayer dice game built for the **Gamba platform on Solana**.

Players create or join head-to-head matches, choose a dice setup and a prediction (over / under / exact), and wager any supported token. After both players join, the game resolves on-chain and the winner takes the pot (minus platform fees).

The project includes a real-time lobby, on-chain multiplayer logic, and a 3D animated dice game screen using Three.js.
